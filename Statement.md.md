📄The Problem Statement

In the real estate industry, forecasting home prices is a prevalent
practical issue. The objective is to develop a machine learning model
that reliably forecasts a home\'s price given characteristics like house
area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location.

#This resolves issues like:

Estimating prices for buyers and sellers

Analysis of market trends

Automated app valuation for real estate

📌 Scope of the Project

This project focuses on:

Linear Regression is being used here.

Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting)

Model training and evaluation

Performance visualization

Making predictions based on user input

#The project does not include:

Deep learning models

Web or mobile deployment

Real-time data scraping

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 target users

students learning machine learning

real estate analysts (basic estimation)
