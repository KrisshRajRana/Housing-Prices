🏡 Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression 📘 Overview of the
Project

This project aims to predict housing prices based on multiple features
such as area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and location. It
demonstrates how machine learning techniques---specifically Linear
Regression---can be applied to solve a real-world regression problem.

The project covers:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Building a Linear Regression model

Evaluating the model

Predicting house prices based on user inputs

⭐ Features

Load and clean housing dataset

Handle missing values and categorical data

Train a Linear Regression model

Predict house prices for new input values

Evaluate model performance (RMSE, R² Score)

Generate visualizations (Actual vs Predicted plot)

Simple user interaction (CLI or Notebook)

🛠️ Technologies / Tools Used

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🧪Guidelines for Testing:-

Launch the script or notebook.

Make sure the dataset file (data.csv) is located in the appropriate
folder.

Execute data preprocessing steps or cells.

The Linear Regression model should be trained.

View evaluation metrics (RMSE & R² Score).

Add some sample inputs:

Area (square feet)

The quantity of bedrooms

Where(Location)

Compare the estimated cost to the known values.

Examine the visual results (prediction graphs).
